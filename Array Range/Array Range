Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.



Output Format:

Output consists of an integer which corresponds to the range of the array.



Sample Input:

5

2

4

1

3

5



Sample Output:

The range of the array is 4

Case 1
Input (stdin)
3
