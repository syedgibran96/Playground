Array insertion
Arun and Ram were playing cards. Arun has 5 cards. Ram wants to insert a new card in between Arun's cards. Ram wants to find the position to insert the card. So help him to find the position to insert a certain card. If Ram inserts a card in a position other than the position of 5 cards, the game will be over. So play carefully. EXAMPLE: consider an array having three elements in it initially and a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 3 and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1 i.e. a[0] = 45, so we have to move elements one step below after insertion a[1] = 1 , and a[2] = 2 and a[3] = 3. 
Input Format:

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.
